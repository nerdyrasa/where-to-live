## Overview ##

This repository contains the source for a web app, built with Python microframework Flask and Bootstrap since I am stylistically challenged. The idea of the web app comes from my desire to relocate--I'm simply tired of Wisconsin winters. Therefore, I'm looking very closely at climate. There are other factors like walkability, affordability, and number of coffee houses, that I will incorporate in future updates

## Requirements ##
I developed this project using a virtual environment in PyCharm using Python 3.4. I use the following packages: 
Flask=0.10.1
Flask-Bootstrap=3.3.5.6
Jinja2=2.8
MarkupSafe=0.23
Werkzeug=0.10.4
dominate=2.1.16
itsdangerous=0.24 

## Running the app ##
Make sure you have all the requirements installed and use python 3.4:
Run `python where_to_live.py`
In the browser type `localhost:5000/city/Raleigh`


## Attribution ##
I relied heavily on the excellent [Intro to Flask video] (https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/an-introduction-to/9781491912386/) for guidance, but in no way copied and pasted my way through this project. 

## Licensing ##
All my code in this repo is [MIT Public License](http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php), but consider it as-is. 

## Next Steps ##
There is still much work to do. I will continue to update this project.
